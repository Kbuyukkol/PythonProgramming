# Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to the world of Python programming! Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you're a complete novice or an experienced programmer, Python has something to offer everyone.

## Getting Started

To start coding in Python, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps to get you started:

1. **Installation**: If you don't already have Python installed on your computer, download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to choose the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Text Editor or IDE**: You can write Python code in a simple text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or a more feature-rich Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Hello, World!**: Start with the classic "Hello, World!" program to ensure your setup is working correctly.

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   
# Running Code: 
Save your Python code with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py) and run it using the Python interpreter. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python file is located, and run:

python hello.py
